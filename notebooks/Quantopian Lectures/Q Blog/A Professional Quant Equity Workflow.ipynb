    "### Universe Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is a less obvious, yet absolutely critical, reason for paring down the security list: successful cross-sectional strategies balance a tension between price dispersion and self-similarity in the universe. By definition, cross-sectional strategies extract relative value across securities and, in order to be able to rank something intelligently, there needs to be some degree of uniformity in the characteristics of the things being ranked.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Alpha Discovery\n",
    "\n",
    "An alpha is an expression applied to the cross section of your universe stocks, which returns a vector of real numbers where these values are predictive of the relative magnitude of future returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alpha could be built frooom a straight rank or it could be a vector of dimensionless numbers. Alphas are oftern referred to as factors, and we use this term interchangeabely. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Pipeline API is your entry iinto the world of alpha modeling At this stage don't worrya bouot real woorld details such as trading, commissions or risk. Create a hypothesis about investor behavioor market structure informatino asymmetry or any other potoential causeof market inefficeincy and see if that hypothesis has any predictive capabilites.\n",

    "### Alpha Combination\n",
    "\n",
    "Rarely is any single alpah significant enough to be the sole basis of an investment strategy. A successful strategy usually includes many individual alphas; if they are strong enough, a few can suffice.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal at this stage is to implmenent a weighting scheme which takes as input many normalized alphas and produces a single alpha which is more predictive than the best individual alpha. \n",
    "\n",
    "The weighting scheme can be quite simple: sometimes just adding ranks or averaging youor laphas can be an effective solutioon. \n",
    "\n",
    "In fact one popular mode does just that to combine two alphas. For increased complexity classic portfolioo theoory can help you.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example try solving for the weights such that the final combined alpha has the lowest possible variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly modern machine learning techniques can capture complex relationships between alphas.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Translating your alphas into features and feeding these into a machine learning classifer is popular vien of research.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Portfolio Construction\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a final alpha vector and we must introduce this alpha to the real world and structure and trade a portfolioo to capture value.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each cycle time of the process we calculate the alphas, combine the alphas into a final alpha, inherit the portfolio from the previous period, take our final alpha and calculate a new ideal \n",
    "\n",
    "i.e., your longs could be equal weights in names in the top quintile and your shorts could be equal weights in names in the bottom quintile with weights set so the portfolio reaches some total invested value long and short, and such that the value of longs equals the (absolute) value of shorts.\n",
    "\n",
    "How fast do I need to trade? How quickly does the predictive power of the alpha decay? \n",
    " Does it make more sense to be passive and execute slowly in the market, or, conversely, does it make more sense to execute aggressively and immediately? \n",
    " You can gain insight into these questions both by viewing the turnover and alpha persistence analysis in the alphalens output for your final alpha as well as looking at the turnover and round trip analysis in the pyfolio output for your fully formed strategy. \n",
    " \n",
    " #### If universe selection is a balance between price dispersion and self-similarity, and portfolio construction is a balance between risk and return, then trading is a balance amongst alpha decay, explicit costs, implicit costs, and information leakage about your total intent.\n",
    " \n",
    " We look for robust high Sharpe ratio strategies that perform well out-of-sample;\n",
    " \n",
    " The search space is very large however, and in this post I’ve outlined a structure that shows how some of the largest and most successful quantitative investors have approached the problem. \n",
